"""Self-check for the roll-identifiability prior in ModelB.fit.

Rule (experiments/refnet/30_roll_identifiability): a photo with <=1 distinct
DIRECT-marker transect (source wire_point / f2g_end) cannot identify camera
roll, so roll is hard-fixed to 0 and only f/h/pitch are fitted; a photo with
>=2 direct transects fits all 4 params (roll free) exactly as before.

Run standalone:
    PYTHONPATH=. ./depthenv/bin/python tests/test_roll_identifiability.py
Or via pytest.
